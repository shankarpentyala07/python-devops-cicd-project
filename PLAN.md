# HTTP Status Checker: Implementation plan

This tool will leverage the `requests` and `click` libraries to build a simple CLI program that can be used to check the health of multiple URLs.

## Core Functionality Requirements

1. **URL Status Checking**
   - Check the HTTP status of one or more URLs
   - Return appropriate status codes (200 OK, 404, 500, etc.) with reason phrases
   - Handle successful responses (2xx status codes) as "OK"
   - Handle error responses with actual status code and reason

2. **Exception Handling**
   - Handle timeout errors and return "TIMEOUT" status
   - Handle connection errors and return "CONNECTION_ERROR" status
   - Handle general request exceptions and return "REQUEST_ERROR: {ExceptionType}" status
   - Gracefully handle any unexpected request-related errors

3. **Configurable Timeout**
   - Support configurable timeout for HTTP requests (default: 5 seconds)
   - Apply timeout consistently across all URL checks

4. **Batch Processing**
   - Process multiple URLs in a single operation
   - Provide `--timeout` option to configure request timeout
   - Provide `--verbose/-v` flag for debug logging
   - Display usage information when no URLs provided

5. **Output Formatting**
   - Display results in a formatted table-like structure
   - Use color coding (green for success, red for errors)
   - Show URL and corresponding status for each check

## Logging Requirements

6. **Comprehensive Logging**
   - Log start and completion of URL checking operations
   - Log individual URL check attempts at debug level
   - Log warnings for timeouts and connection errors
   - Log errors for unexpected exceptions with full stack traces
   - Support configurable log levels (INFO by default, DEBUG with verbose flag)

## Installation & Distribution Requirements

7. **Package Distribution**
   - Installable as a Python package
   - Provide console script entry point (`check-urls` command)
   - Include proper dependency management (requests, click)
   - Support Python 3.9+ compatibility
